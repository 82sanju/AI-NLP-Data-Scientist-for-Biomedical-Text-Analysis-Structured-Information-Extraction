# AI-NLP-Data-Scientist-for-Biomedical-Text-Analysis-Structured-Information-Extraction
Developed a biomedical NLP pipeline using transformers (BioBERT, PubMedBERT, SciSpacy) to extract entities (drugs, diseases, adverse events) and relations from literature. Ensured schema-conformant outputs, reproducible Python codebase, and high-precision evaluation results.

Biomedical NLP: Entity & Relation Extraction

This project focuses on biomedical text analysis to extract entities (e.g., drugs, diseases, adverse events) and identify relations (e.g., drug ‚Üí adverse event). The outputs are structured according to a predefined schema, making them suitable for safety, regulatory, and research applications.
